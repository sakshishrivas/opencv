# opencv   
Open cv is a Python open -source library which is used for computer vision in AI,ML ,FACE RECCOGNITION etc.
It helps in tasks like object detection, face recognition, image transformation, and more.
Includes several hundreds ofcomputer vision algorithms.
It has C++,Python,Java and Matplotlib interfaces and support windows,linux,Android and MacOS.
Opencv is wriiten natively in C++.
Initial release June 2000: 20 year ago
Open cv is available free of cost.
Since opencv library is written in C++/C ,so it is quite fast,It can be used with Python
Requires less RAM to usage ,it may be of 60-70 MB.

Basic OpenCV Operations
OpenCV is widely used for image and video processing. Here are some fundamental operations in OpenCV with Python.

üìå 1. Read & Display an Image
Load an image and display it using OpenCV.

import cv2  

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread("image.jpg")  

# Display the image
cv2.imshow("Image Window", img)  

# Wait for a key press and close the window
cv2.waitKey(0)  
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
üé® 2. Convert Image to Grayscale
Convert a colored image into grayscale.
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
cv2.imshow("Grayscale Image", gray)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
‚úÇ 3. Resize an Image
Change the dimensions of an image.
resized = cv2.resize(img, (300, 300))  # Resize to 300x300 pixels
cv2.imshow("Resized Image", resized)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
üîÑ 4. Rotate an Image
Rotate an image by 90 degrees.
rotated = cv2.rotate(img, cv2.ROTATE_90_CLOCKWISE)
cv2.imshow("Rotated Image", rotated)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
‚úç 5. Draw Shapes on an Image
Draw a rectangle, circle, and line on an image.
# Draw a rectangle
cv2.rectangle(img, (50, 50), (200, 200), (0, 255, 0), 3)

# Draw a circle
cv2.circle(img, (250, 250), 50, (255, 0, 0), -1)  # -1 fills the shape

# Draw a line
cv2.line(img, (0, 0), (400, 400), (0, 0, 255), 2)

cv2.imshow("Shapes", img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
üîç 6. Detect Edges using Canny Edge Detection
Find edges in an image using the Canny algorithm.
edges = cv2.Canny(img, 100, 200)
cv2.imshow("Edge Detection", edges)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
üñº 7. Blur an Image
Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise in an image.
blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (15, 15), 0)
cv2.imshow("Blurred Image", blurred)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
ü§ñ 8. Face Detection using Haar Cascades
Detect faces in an image.
# Load pre-trained classifier
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# Convert image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Detect faces
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.3, 5)

# Draw rectangles around faces
for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
    cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (255, 0, 0), 2)

cv2.imshow("Face Detection", img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
üé• 9. Capture Video from Webcam
Read frames from the webcam and display them.
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 for default webcam

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    cv2.imshow("Webcam Feed", frame)
    
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):  # Press 'q' to exit
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
üé≠ 10. Save an Image
Save an image after processing.
cv2.imwrite("output.jpg", img)  # Save image as output.jpg
